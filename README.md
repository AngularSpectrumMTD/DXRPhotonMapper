### Algorithm
Photon Mapping : Hashed Grid  
Denoiser : SVGF(Currently Disabled)  
Shading : GGX

### Debug View
Enable to check (Diffuse)Albedo / Depth / Normal

### How To Use
**NOTE : This program can only handle triangular polygons**

---
#### With Simple Scene (Easy)
1. Set "SceneType_Simple" to the variable "mSceneType" at void DxrPhotonMapper::Setup()[DxrPhotonMapper.cpp]  
2. Build and Execute  
---
#### With Sponza
1. Download model(sponza) from "McGuire Computer Graphics Archive"(https://casual-effects.com/data/)  
2. Open sponza.obj on blender. Set the size to 0.1 -> Execute Triangulation.  
4. Export 3D model as obj file(Name the file "sponza.obj")  
5. Create a new folder "sponza" in "DXRPhotonMapper/PhotonMapper/model" and copy the "textures" and "sponza.mtl" file from the downloaded folder and the obj file you just exported to the folder you just created.  
6. Set "SceneType_Sponza" to the variable "mSceneType" at void DxrPhotonMapper::Setup()[DxrPhotonMapper.cpp]  
7. Build and Execute
---
#### With Bistro
1. Download model(bistro) from "McGuire Computer Graphics Archive"(https://casual-effects.com/data/)  
2. Open exterior.obj / interior.obj on blender. Set the size to 0.1 -> Execute Triangulation.  
3. Export 3D model as obj file(Name the file "exterior.obj"/"interior.obj")  
4. Create a new folder "bistro" in "DXRPhotonMapper/PhotonMapper/model". Then copy the "BuildingTextures" and "Exterior" and "OtherTextures" and "PropTextures" from the downloaded folder to the created folder. Then place the created exterior.obj / interior.obj file in the "Exterior" / "Interior".  
5. Set "SceneType_BistroExterior" / "SceneType_BistroInterior" to the variable "mSceneType" at void DxrPhotonMapper::Setup()[DxrPhotonMapper.cpp]  
6. Build and Execute
